# Intregal Computation
This simple algorithm implements two types of computing an area: the first one uses a "monte-carlo" algorithm based on the casual generation of points, while the second one implements the "Jeff-Cavalieri" method used to aproximate the area with some parobolic functions. This project was part of the presentation of the 5th year HighSchool final exam.
